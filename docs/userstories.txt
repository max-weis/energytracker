  - Task 1.3.2: Implement an API endpoint to retrieve all price records.
  - Task 1.3.3: Add filtering/sorting options (by date or type) in the UI.
  - Task 1.3.4: Ensure responsive design for different devices.

------------------------------------------------------------
Epic 2: Meter Reading Management

User Story 2.1: Record Meter Readings
  As a user, I want to record my current electricity and gas meter readings so that my consumption data is captured regularly.
  - Task 2.1.1: Create a user-friendly form for entering meter readings.
  - Task 2.1.2: Validate inputs to avoid incorrect or duplicate entries.
  - Task 2.1.3: Develop a backend endpoint to store meter reading data with timestamps.
  - Task 2.1.4: Set up a database model for meter readings.

User Story 2.2: View Aggregated Meter Readings
  As a user, I want to view my meter readings aggregated by week, month, quarter, and year so that I can identify consumption trends.
  - Task 2.2.1: Define aggregation logic on the backend (grouping readings by time periods).
  - Task 2.2.2: Design a UI component (charts/tables) to display aggregated data.
  - Task 2.2.3: Provide options to switch between different time scales.
  - Task 2.2.4: Implement caching if needed for performance.

------------------------------------------------------------
Epic 3: Expenditure Tracking

User Story 3.1: Compute Expenditures
  As a user, I want the system to compute expenditures based on meter readings and corresponding prices so that I can see my energy spending.
  - Task 3.1.1: Develop the calculation logic that links meter readings with the effective price at the time.
  - Task 3.1.2: Create API endpoints for expenditure computation.
  - Task 3.1.3: Implement unit tests to verify correct calculations.
  - Task 3.1.4: Integrate error handling for missing or mismatched data.

User Story 3.2: View Expenditure Summaries
  As a user, I want to view my energy expenditures summarized by week, month, quarter, and year to better analyze my spending patterns.
  - Task 3.2.1: Create a UI view that presents expenditure summaries (tables, graphs, etc.).
  - Task 3.2.2: Implement filtering mechanisms to allow time period selection.
  - Task 3.2.3: Connect the UI with the backend aggregation logic.
  - Task 3.2.4: Optimize queries for quick response times.

------------------------------------------------------------
Epic 4: Forecasting and Interpolation

User Story 4.1: Forecast Future Usage and Expenditures
  As a user, I want the app to estimate future energy usage and costs based on historical trends so that I can plan ahead.
  - Task 4.1.1: Research and select appropriate interpolation/forecasting algorithms.
  - Task 4.1.2: Implement the algorithm on historical meter readings and pricing data.
  - Task 4.1.3: Create an API endpoint that returns forecasted data.
  - Task 4.1.4: Validate and test forecasting accuracy with historical data.

User Story 4.2: Compare Actual vs. Forecasted Data
  As a user, I want to compare my actual energy usage with forecasted trends to identify any discrepancies.
  - Task 4.2.1: Design a comparison view (side-by-side or overlay charts).
  - Task 4.2.2: Integrate forecasted and actual data on the dashboard.
  - Task 4.2.3: Provide visual cues (colors, labels) to highlight differences.
  - Task 4.2.4: Implement user feedback for refining forecast parameters.

------------------------------------------------------------
Epic 5: Dashboard and Reporting

User Story 5.1: Display a Summary Dashboard
  As a user, I want a dashboard that provides quick insights into my current meter readings, pricing trends, expenditures, and forecasts so that I have a holistic view of my energy usage.
  - Task 5.1.1: Design the dashboard layout with sections for each key metric.
  - Task 5.1.2: Create UI components (charts, tables) to represent data summaries.
  - Task 5.1.3: Integrate real-time data fetching from the backend.
  - Task 5.1.4: Ensure the dashboard is responsive and intuitive.

User Story 5.2: Filter and Drill Down into Data
  As a user, I want to filter data by different time ranges (week, month, quarter, year) and drill down into detailed reports so that I can perform in-depth analysis of my consumption and spending.
  - Task 5.2.1: Implement filtering controls in the UI.
